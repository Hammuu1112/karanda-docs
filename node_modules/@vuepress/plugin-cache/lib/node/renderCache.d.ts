/**
 * When various features are added to markdown, the compilation speed of a single markdown file
 * will become slower, especially when there are many pages in the project,
 * causing the startup of the vuepress development service to become very slow and time-consuming.
 * This plugin will cache the `markdown render` result during the initial compilation process.
 * During subsequent compilations, if the content has not been modified,
 * compilation will be skipped directly, thus speeding up the second startup of vuepress.
